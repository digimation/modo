# Beautiful Patterns Open Source Internships

## Getting Started
If you are interested in applying to be an Open Source Intern at Beautiful Patterns, read the sections below.

## Understand Beautiful Patterns
Your first step should be to understand Beautiful Pattern and what we do. We're not simply an open source software project like many other organizations. You can start reading about us at our official website and you can find plenty of information through searching about us. You'll need to know a decent amount about us in order to help us effectively.

If you have a question about how we work, our programs, or anything like that, please don't hesitate to ask!

## Join the Community
Join the #bp-dev-internships channel on Slack or the BP Developers mailing list as early as possible to introduce yourself and get feedback on your ideas. All our mentors will be on Slack and respond to emails on the mailing list and it is better to post there rather than contacting them individually. Feel free to ask questions!

## Pick a Project
Your next step should be to pick a particular project that you're interested in working on. 

Once you pick the project you're interested in, make sure to learn about the project thoroughly. You're going to be spending one year working on the project and you'll need to understand what the work entails so that you can plan the work out ahead of time and submit a strong application. The project descriptions are quite short so we expect you to do a lot of work here duron your own taking those descriptions and fleshing them out into a more detailed project plan and implementation timeline.

The mentors are here to help you. We expect you to have a lot of questions along the way and we're happy to answer them.

## Contribute
You will need to make at least one contribution to a Beautiful Patterns project so that we can see a sample of your work. This is important for our evaluation of your application. For more details, see the Contributing section, below.

## Draft Application
The final step is to create a draft application and share it with your chosen project's mentors for feedback. Do not wait until the last minute to do this. You should ideally get at least two rounds of feedback from the mentors before you submit your final application. For more details, see the Application section, below.

## Contributing 

### Why Contribute?
Contributions are for you to get a sense of what it's like to contribute to an open source project (getting used to the GitHub workflow, interacting with other contributors, etc.) and for us to see a sample of your work/skills. If we are impressed by your contributions, we are more likely to select you as an intern.

### How to Contrinute
Please read our Contributing Code page for information on how to contribute. You can contribute to any Beautiful Patterns repository, although it's better if you demonstrate skills related to the project you are applying for. Also, check your project's description for more specific contribution guidelines (not all of them will have them).

### Contributing Documentation
If you are applying for a Documentation Open Source Internship, one of the best ways you can contribute to documentation is to find places where documentation can be improved, and open an issue for it on GitHub. Be sure to state what, specifically, could be improved, and how you plan to improve it.

We prefer to see contributions that make substantive changes or improvements to documentation such as improving the clarity of existing documentation or creating new documentation. Typo and grammar fixes are, of course, still welcome, but we do like to see more substantive improvements.

## Application 
Your final application is very important to us. This is what we will use to determine how well you understand the project and how likely you are to successfully complete it. As part of the application, you should take the project description and flesh it out into a more detailed project plan and implementation timeline. The project descriptions are all fairly short and some of them include multiple paths for the project. So, we expect you to do a lot of work here to turn those into a feasible plan and timeline for a complete project that you can ship during your internship.

This is not something you should be working on in isolation. We expect you to have a lot of questions for the mentors along the way as you try and understand the project, come up with ideas, evaluate feasibility, etc. We also expect you to come up with a first draft and get feedback from mentors before you submit the final application on the program's official site.

We suggest reading some articles on writing good proposals. 

## Template 
You must use our internship project template to create your application. Please make sure that your mentors have comment permissions before you share your document with them.

## Contacting Mentors
All the Beautiful Patterns mentors are on Slack. Please use public channels on Slack as the primary method of communication. Public channels are better than direct messages because it allows any available mentor (or even another applicant) to answer your questions and interact with you. It also allows other applicants who have the same questions to benefit from the answers the mentor is giving you.

Please ask mentors specific questions. We don't know how to help you get started unless we know what you have questions about. People come from a variety of experiences and backgrounds and the things you may be confused about may be totally different than the things that someone else has questions about. Please give us as much information as possible, the more you tell us, the better we can help you.

Remember that the mentors are busy â€“ we've got full-time jobs or other commitments. It's good to follow up if you don't get a response, but wait a couple of days first.

Please refrain from addressing mentors as "sir" or "ma'am". We prefer to be addressed by our first names or usernames.


## Intern Selection Criteria
Here are a few things we consider when selecting interns:

* Quality of the proposal: This is the most important thing. A good proposal includes attention to detail, externally measurable milestones, consideration for future maintainability and community involvement, and a demonstration of your skills.
* Community involvement: One of our major goals is to build an active development community and attract long-term contributors. We see engaging in the community, whether it's asking questions, helping other students, contributing code, filing bugs, or whatever else, as a sign that you're genuinely interested in our work.
* Contributions: We appreciate seeing your contributions, they help us gauge your ability to orient yourself to a new codebase, or the quality of your writing. Contribution quality is instrumental in giving us the confidence that you have the skills necessary to implement your proposal.
* Communication skills and initiative: These are essential to completing a successful project. Things we look for (among others): asking specific and detailed questions, following up on conversations, making sure to read available resources before asking questions, being patient and responding to critical feedback well.

## Number of Accepted Interns
Please, note that any internship program has a limited amount of projects. Therefore, we will probably not be able to select an intern for every project idea that we have listed. We can only accept the number of interns that we have slots for.

## Selection Accouncements
If you have been selected, congratulations! Here's what we expect you to do before the internship officially starts:

* Continue to refine your project plan and timeline with your mentors.
* Define communication channels and set up a weekly check-in with your mentor.
* Set up your computer and development environment.
* Familiarize yourself with the development process at Beautiful Patterns (pull requests, code review).
* Introduce yourself to the members of BP's engineering team.

INTERNSHIP PERIOD
## Internship Period
Once the internship starts, here's what we expect of you:

* Work 6-10 hours per week (or agree on a different plan with your mentor ahead of time).
* Push code to GitHub frequently. Commit early and often.
* Be available on Slack whenever you are working and post at least once a (work)day to talk about what you're working on that day.
* Write a short update on your work every two weeks and post it to the BP technical blog (instructions are here). To get a sense of how these posts are written and how the projects evolved, you can read entries done by previous interns.
* Attend your weekly check-in with your mentor and any other meetings.
* Be proactive about asking for help, especially when you're stuck.
* Ensure that you're on track to delivering your project at the end of the work period. If you're not on track, talk with your mentor to come up with a new plan for the project well before the deadline.
* Let your mentor and the organization admins know when you are going to be unavailable. If something sudden comes up, let us know.
